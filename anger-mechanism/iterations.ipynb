By streamlining regulations and reducing red tape, we can help small businesses operate more efficiently and focus on growth rather than administrative tasks.\n",

      "Secondly, I plan to implement targeted tax incentives. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve support. By offering tax credits for hiring new employees, investing in research and development, and expanding operations, we can encourage small businesses to grow and create more jobs.\n",
      "\n",
