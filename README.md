Step into the shoes of a TV debate presenter tasked with helping a candidate win the election. Your mission? Polarize the public’s opinion by cleverly angling the debate against your opponent. Chose wisely your questions to stir up emotions, but beware—cross the line and you might push the opponent to leave the stage!

In our game, the player doesn't directly control the candidate seeking to win the debate by polarizing the opinion against his opponent. To reach this goal, the player controls the TV presenter who influences the course of the debates through carefully chosen questions. The presenter’s choices indirectly affect the debaters’ emotions and the public’s opinion. 

Our theme encouraged us to explore new ways of influencing characters and outcomes without directly controlling the characters themselves, which is exactly what our game proposes by steering the environment to make our champion win the game.
