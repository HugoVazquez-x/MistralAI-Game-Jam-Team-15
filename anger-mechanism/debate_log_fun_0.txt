[MODERATOR] Question: How will your policies affect small businesses?

[Donald Trump] Réponse: "Let me tell you, folks, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They create jobs, they innovate, they make our communities thrive. And let me tell you, my policies are going to give them the boost they need to really take off.

First off, we're going to cut through all that red tape. You know, all those regulations that make it harder for small businesses to operate? We're going to streamline them, make them more efficient. We're talking about less paperwork, less bureaucracy, and more freedom for our entrepreneurs.

Secondly, we're going to lower taxes. Big time. We're talking about a tax cut that's going to put more money in the pockets of small business owners. They'll have more to invest, more to grow, more to hire. It's a win-win.

And let me tell you, we're not just going to talk about it, we're going to do it. We're going to make sure that our small businesses have access to the capital they need to expand. We're talking about loans, grants, all the tools they need to succeed.

Now, I know what you're thinking. 'That sounds great, but how are we going to pay for it?' Well, let me tell you, we're going to make sure that the big corporations, the ones who are doing just fine, they're going to pay their fair share. We're not going to let them off the hook.

So, folks, my policies are going to give our small businesses the boost they need. They're going to create jobs, they're going to grow our economy, and they're going to make our communities stronger. It's a no-brainer. We're going to make America great again, and it's going to start with our small businesses."

[Kamala Harris] Réponse: Thank you for asking about my plans for small businesses. I understand that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I'm committed to policies that support their growth and sustainability.

Firstly, I propose a reduction in the corporate tax rate for small businesses. This will provide them with more capital to invest in expansion, innovation, and job creation. Additionally, I will introduce tax incentives for businesses that hire new employees, particularly those from underrepresented communities.

Secondly, I will work to simplify the regulatory environment for small businesses. This includes streamlining the permitting process and reducing the burden of compliance with federal regulations. By making it easier for small businesses to operate, we can encourage entrepreneurship and foster economic growth.

Lastly, I will expand access to affordable credit for small businesses. This includes increasing funding for small business loans and creating new programs to support minority-owned and women-owned businesses. By providing small businesses with the financial resources they need to succeed, we can help them thrive and contribute to our economy.

In summary, my policies aim to create a supportive environment for small businesses, enabling them to grow, innovate, and create jobs. I believe that by investing in small businesses, we can drive sustainable economic growth and address income inequality.

[MODERATOR] Question: What is your plan to reduce unemployment?

[Donald Trump] Réponse: To address the question about reducing unemployment, I will build upon the themes of supporting small businesses and creating a favorable economic environment. Here's a plan to reduce unemployment:

---

"Let me tell you, folks, reducing unemployment is a top priority for me. We need to create an environment where businesses can thrive and hire more people. Here's how we're going to do it:

First, we're going to continue to cut through the red tape that's holding our economy back. We need to make it easier for businesses to operate, to expand, and to hire. By streamlining regulations and reducing bureaucracy, we'll give businesses the freedom they need to grow and create jobs.

Second, we're going to lower taxes. Big time. Lower taxes mean more money in the pockets of businesses, which means they can invest more, grow more, and hire more. It's simple economics. When businesses have more money, they can create more jobs.

Third, we're going to make sure that our small businesses have access to the capital they need to expand. We're talking about loans, grants, all the tools they need to succeed. When small businesses can grow, they create jobs. And when they create jobs, unemployment goes down.

Now, let me address the elephant in the room. Some people are worried about how we're going to pay for all this. Well, let me tell you, we're not going to let the big corporations off the hook. They've been doing just fine, and it's time they contribute their fair share. We're going to make sure that everyone pays their fair share, so that we can invest in our economy and create jobs.

And let me tell you, folks, we're not just going to talk about it, we're going to do it. We're going to make sure that our economy is strong, that our businesses are thriving, and that our communities are prospering. We're going to create jobs, and we're going to make America great again.

So, let's get to work. Let's create an environment where businesses can thrive, where they can grow, and where they can create jobs. Let's reduce unemployment and make our economy the envy of the world. It's a no-brainer. We're going to make America great again, and it's going to start with creating jobs for all Americans."

[Kamala Harris] Réponse: To address unemployment, I propose a multi-faceted approach that focuses on job creation, workforce development, and targeted support for vulnerable populations. Here are the key components of my plan:

1. **Invest in Infrastructure and Green Jobs:**
   - I will prioritize infrastructure investments, such as roads, bridges, and public transportation, which will create immediate job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.
   - Additionally, I will invest in green energy and sustainability projects, creating jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and environmental conservation.

2. **Expand Workforce Development Programs:**
   - I will expand access to vocational training, apprenticeship programs, and job placement services to help workers acquire the skills needed for in-demand jobs.
   - I will also invest in education and workforce development initiatives to ensure that our workforce is prepared for the jobs of the future.

3. **Targeted Support for Vulnerable Populations:**
   - I will implement policies to support low-income workers, such as increasing the minimum wage, expanding access to affordable childcare, and providing paid family leave.
   - I will also focus on addressing the unique challenges faced by communities of color, women, and other marginalized groups by investing in targeted job training, mentorship programs, and entrepreneurship initiatives.

4. **Support for Small Businesses:**
   - As I mentioned earlier, supporting small businesses is crucial for job creation. By reducing regulatory burdens, providing affordable credit, and offering tax incentives for hiring, we can help small businesses grow and create jobs.

5. **Fiscal Policy and Economic Stimulus:**
   - I will use fiscal policy to stimulate economic growth and job creation. This includes targeted tax cuts for low- and middle-income workers, investments in infrastructure, and support for small businesses.

By implementing these policies, we can create a more inclusive and resilient economy that provides opportunities for all Americans to thrive. My approach is methodical, data-driven, and focused on creating sustainable, long-term solutions to reduce unemployment and promote economic growth.

First, we need to cut wasteful spending. There's a lot of money being thrown away by the government that could be used to invest in our economy and create jobs. We're going to cut the fat, and we're going to make sure that every dollar is spent wisely.

Now, let me address the elephant in the room. Some people are worried about how we're going to pay for all this. Well, let me tell you, we're not going to let the big corporations off the hook.

[Kamala Harris] Réponse: Thank you for asking about my plan to tackle national debt. Addressing our national debt is a critical issue that requires a balanced and responsible approach. Here are the key components of my strategy:

1. **Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Reform:**
   - I will work to reduce wasteful spending and ensure that our government operates efficiently. This includes streamlining government programs, reducing administrative costs, and eliminating unnecessary spending.
   - I will also prioritize investments in areas that drive economic growth and job creation, such as infrastructure, education, and research and development.

3. **Economic Growth and Job Creation:**
   - By investing in infrastructure, education, and workforce development, we can stimulate economic growth and create jobs. A stronger economy will generate more tax revenue, helping to reduce the debt.
   - I will also support policies that promote innovation and entrepreneurship, such as research and development tax credits and small business loans.

4. **Debt Management:**
   - I will work to manage our debt responsibly, ensuring that we pay down the debt in a way that does not harm our economy. This includes prioritizing debt repayment while also investing in areas that drive long-term economic growth.
   - I will also explore ways to reduce the cost of borrowing, such as by improving our credit rating and reducing interest rates.

5. **Transparency and Accountability:**
   - I will ensure that our budget process is transparent and accountable, with regular updates and public reporting on our progress towards reducing the debt.
   - I will also work to build bipartisan consensus on fiscal policy, ensuring that our debt reduction efforts are sustainable and supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders.

By implementing these policies, we can address our national debt in a responsible and sustainable way, while also promoting economic growth and job creation. My approach is methodical, data-driven, and focused on creating long-term solutions that benefit all Americans.
