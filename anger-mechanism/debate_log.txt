[MODERATOR] Question: How will your policies affect small businesses?

[Donald Trump] Réponse: Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to address the elephant in the room. You're all here because you want to know how my economic policies will affect small businesses. Let me tell you, I have a plan that will make small businesses the backbone of our economy once again.

Firstly, we're going to cut red tape. I've seen it firsthand, the mountains of paperwork that small business owners have to climb. It's a nightmare. My administration will streamline regulations, making it easier and faster for small businesses to start, grow, and thrive. We'll also reduce the tax burden on small businesses, giving them more money to invest in their employees and their communities.

Secondly, we're going to invest in infrastructure. You know, roads, bridges, broadband. These are the lifelines of small businesses. When we invest in infrastructure, we're investing in the future of small businesses. We'll create jobs, stimulate growth, and make it easier for small businesses to reach new markets.

Thirdly, we're going to support small business owners. We'll provide them with access to capital, mentorship, and training. We'll create a Small Business Growth Fund to help small businesses expand and innovate. And we'll make sure that our trade policies are fair and beneficial to small businesses, not just big corporations.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "That sounds great, but how are you going to pay for it?" Well, let me tell you, we're going to close loopholes and make sure that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. We're not going to raise taxes on the middle class. We're going to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, and we're going to use that money to invest in our economy and our people.

So, let's make a deal. Let's put small businesses first. Let's create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. Let's make America prosperous again. Thank you, and God bless America!

[Kamala Harris] Réponse: Thank you for asking about my economic policies and their impact on small businesses. I understand that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I'm committed to supporting them in a way that fosters sustainable growth and addresses income inequality.

Firstly, my policies aim to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses. I propose streamlining regulations and reducing red tape, making it easier and less costly for small businesses to operate and expand. This will not only help them grow but also create more jobs and stimulate economic activity.

Secondly, I plan to provide targeted tax relief for small businesses. This includes reducing the corporate tax rate and offering tax credits for businesses that invest in their employees' training and development. By doing so, we can encourage small businesses to reinvest in their growth and their workforce, leading to a more skilled and productive labor force.

Additionally, I will focus on improving access to capital for small businesses. This includes expanding access to affordable loans and grants, as well as promoting alternative financing options like crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. By making it easier for small businesses to access the capital they need, we can help them overcome financial barriers and achieve their full potential.

Lastly, I will prioritize infrastructure investment, ensuring that small businesses have access to the roads, broadband, and other essential services they need to thrive. This includes investing in rural and underserved communities, where small businesses often face unique challenges.

In summary, my economic policies are designed to create a supportive environment for small businesses, helping them to grow, create jobs, and contribute to a more prosperous and equitable economy. I'm confident that these policies will lead to sustainable growth and address income inequality, benefiting all Americans.

[MODERATOR] Question: How do you intend to tackle national debt?

[Donald Trump] Réponse: Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let's talk about the elephant in the room that's been weighing down our economy: the national debt. I understand your concerns, and I'm here to tell you that we can address this issue without sacrificing our future or our values.

Firstly, let me be clear: we're not going to solve the national debt problem by raising taxes on the middle class. That's not the American way. Instead, we're going to focus on growing our economy and creating jobs. When our economy grows, so does our tax base, and that means more revenue for our government without raising taxes on the people who work hard every day.

Secondly, we're going to cut wasteful spending. There's a lot of money being spent in Washington that doesn't need to be. We're going to cut the fat, and we're going to make sure that every dollar spent is spent wisely and effectively. We're not going to waste money on projects that don't benefit the American people.

Thirdly, we're going to make sure that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. We're not going to let them hide their money in offshore accounts or take advantage of loopholes. We're going to close those loopholes and make sure that everyone pays their fair share. That means more revenue for our government, and that means less debt.

Fourthly, we're going to invest in our economy and our people. We're going to invest in infrastructure, in education, in healthcare, and in small businesses. When we invest in our economy, we're creating jobs, we're stimulating growth, and we're making our country stronger. And when we invest in our people, we're making sure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "That sounds great, but how are you going to pay for it?" Well, let me tell you, we're going to pay for it by growing our economy, by cutting wasteful spending, by making sure that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, and by investing in our future. We're not going to raise taxes on the middle class. We're going to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, and we're going to use that money to invest in our economy and our people.

So, let's make a deal. Let's put America first. Let's create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. Let's make America prosperous again. Let's make America great again. Thank you, and God bless America!

[Kamala Harris] Réponse: To tackle national debt, I propose a multi-faceted approach that balances short-term fiscal responsibility with long-term economic growth. Here are the key components of my plan:

   - **Spending Cuts:** I will identify and eliminate wasteful spending and inefficiencies in the federal budget. This includes reviewing and streamlining federal programs to ensure they are effective and delivering the intended results.

   - **Pension Reform:** I will work to address the pension crisis facing many states and municipalities. This includes exploring options to ensure that pension funds are adequately funded and that retirees receive the benefits they have earned.

By implementing these policies, we can address the national debt in a responsible and sustainable manner while promoting economic growth and addressing income inequality. I am confident that these policies will lead to a more prosperous and equitable economy for all Americans.
